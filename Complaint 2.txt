Subject: Unauthorized Occupation of Reserved Seat

Respected Sir/Madam,

I wish to bring to your attention an issue I faced during my recent journey.

Train No.: 22640

PNR Number: 6743901285

Coach No.: A1, Seat 23 (Upper Berth)

Date of Travel: 18th September 2025

From: Kochi (ERNAKULAM SOUTH)

To: Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC)

Issue Observed At: Alappuzha Station, around 4:45 PM

My reserved seat was occupied by another passenger without authorization, and despite repeated requests, he did not vacate the seat. This caused immense discomfort during my journey.

I urge the authorities to enforce stricter checks to ensure passengers occupy only their allotted seats.

Regards,
Anand
