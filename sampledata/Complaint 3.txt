Subject: Complaint Regarding Lack of Coach Cleanliness

Respected Sir/Madam,

I would like to highlight my grievance during my recent travel.

Train No.: 16345

PNR Number: 9821456730

Coach No.: S4, Seat 65

Date of Travel: 20th September 2025

From: Ernakulam Junction (ERS)

To: Palakkad Junction (PGT)

Issue Observed At: Shoranur Junction, 7:30 PM

The coach was not cleaned properly, and garbage was left unattended near the entry door and under the seats. This created an unhygienic environment for travelers.

I request immediate corrective measures to maintain cleanliness standards.

Thank you,
Arjun Kumar
