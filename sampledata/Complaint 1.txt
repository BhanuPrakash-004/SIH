To: KMRL Railway Department
Subject: Complaint Regarding Food Quality and Cleanliness

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the poor services I experienced during my recent journey.

Train No.: 12678

PNR Number: 4553217890

Coach No.: B2, Seat 36

Date of Travel: 15th September 2025

From: Ernakulam Junction (ERS)

To: Kozhikode (CLT)

Issue Observed At: Thrissur Station around 11:20 AM

During the journey, the food supplied was of substandard quality and not suitable for consumption. Additionally, I noticed lack of cleanliness in the coach, especially near the washrooms. Such conditions caused severe inconvenience to passengers.

I request your department to look into this matter and take necessary action to improve onboard services.

Sincerely,
Sanjay Kumar
